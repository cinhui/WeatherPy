The task was to create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world utilizing citiPy and the OpenWeatherMap API.

The following series of scatter plots were generated:

<ul>
  <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
<ul>
